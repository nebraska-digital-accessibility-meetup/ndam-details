### Purpose
This Code of Conduct describes what we expect from everyone who participates in the meetup, and describes what will happen when someone breaks the Code of Conduct.

We ask everyone who takes part in the meetup to help us make it a good and safe experience for everyone.

### Scope
We expect everyone who takes part in the Nebraska Digital Accessibility meetup to comply with this Code of Conduct in all online and offline meetup venues, and in all online and offline communication relating to the meetup. This includes the organisers, sponsors, contributors (paid or otherwise), participants, and guests.

This Code of Conduct also applies to unacceptable behaviour outside of the meetup, when such behaviour has the potential to affect the safety and well-being of participants.

### Recognition
We want everyone to understand the relationship between their words and actions, and the way the Nebraska Digital Accessibility Meetup community works together.

We encourage everyone to take deliberate and positive actions, so the community does not have the same types of inequality found in society.

If you notice someone who is making an extra effort to make the community friendly and welcoming, compliment them for their good work. You can do this personally, or by letting the organisers know.

* Recognise others who make an extra effort to make the meetup friendly, welcoming, and who encourage others to take part.
* Be mindful of your surroundings, and of your fellow participants.
* Alert the meetup organisers if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct (even if they seem inconsequential).
* If attending the meetup in a venue that may be shared with members of the public, be respectful to all patrons at the venue.

### Unacceptable behaviour
The following things are considered to be unacceptable behaviour:

* Violence or threats of violence.
* Encouraging violence towards any person, including suicide or self-harm.
* Offensive or hurtful comments about gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental health, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, religion (or lack thereof), or socio-economic status.
* Unnescessary or off-topic sexual images.
* Posting or threatening to post other people's personal information (known as "doxing").
* deliberate mis-use of people's preferred pronouns.
* Inappropriate photography or recording without permission.

* Unwelcome sexual attention, including sexualized comments and jokes, inappropriate physical contact and sexual advances.
* Deliberate intimidation and stalking (online or offline).
* Sustained and deliberate interruption of the meetup.
* Encouraging or supporting any of the things in this list.


### Consequences
If someone is asked to stop unacceptable behaviour, they are expected to do so immediately.

If someone engages in unacceptable behaviour, the organisers may take any action they believe is appropriate. This includes (but is not limited to) temporary or permanent expulsion from the meetup (offenders will be reported and blocked to the fullest extent possible by the platform they are using).

### Reporting
If you experience unacceptable behaviour, or you witness someone behaving in an unacceptable way, please contact <organizer email> immediately.

### Grievances
If you feel you have been unfairly accused of unacceptable behaviour, please contact <organizer email> immediately, and include a concise description of your grievance.
